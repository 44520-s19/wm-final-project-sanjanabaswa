# Web Mining Final Project
## Top 5 YouTube Users by subscribers
### Question 
##### How to find the top 5 YouTube channels, and  analyze the subscribers and  views of those channels?
### Introduction
##### To find the channels list with more number of subscribers I'm using "socialblade website".I web scraped the top 5 Youtube channels by subscribers and collected data.I Cleaned the data collected and Visualized the results in BarGraphs.
### Libraries Required
##### 1.BeautifulSoup
##### 2.Pandas
##### 3.Requests
##### 4.Matplotlib
##### 5.Seaborn
### Procedure
##### Web Scraping a YouTube Website https://socialblade.com/youtube/ by sending html requests.
##### Pickling the data.
##### Importing data in to pandas
##### Cleaning the data.
##### Visualizing the results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
### Conculsion
##### From both the graphs we can clearly state that "T -Series" is a channel with highest number of subscribers and views.
##### We can also see that the 2nd ranked channel "PewDiePie" has more subscribers than the 4th ranked channel " Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes" but not the views.
##### From the above two graphs, I can conclude that even if a channel is top rated based on the number of subscribers, they may have less number of views.
